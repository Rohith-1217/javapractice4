Problem 1:

-->The program takes string as input and will find the count of occurences of given character.

	Input  : "rohith hit" is the string and selected character is 'h'
	output : 3

Problem 2:

-->The program takes string as input and will replace the letters 'd' with 'f' and 'l' with 't'.

	Input  : "all good" is the string and now it will replace the letters as shown in statement
	output : "att goof"

Problem 3:

-->The program takes string as input and display the letters in reverse order.

	Input  : "rohith sai" is the string and now it will reverse the letters
	output : "ahhiiorst"

Problem 4:

-->The program takes string as input and display the words in reverse order.

	Input  : "all good" is the string and now it will reverse the words given.
	output : "lla doog"

Problem 5:

-->We will implement Regular Expression​ and find the presence of name Harry in given string​ and implement to test cases.

	Test case 1:
	Input  : "this is harry" is the given string and substring is "harry"
	output : true - because the given word is present.

	Test case 1:
	Input  : "this is harry" is the given string and substring is "good"
	output : false - because the given word is not present.
	

Problem 6:

-->The program takes string as input and finds the multiple occurences of the given word in the string.

	Input:"rohith hit" is the given string and prints the starting and ending index of substring
	output:"2-4,7-9"
